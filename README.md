# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
  The purpose of this analysis was to determine the number of retiring employees per title at Pewlett-Hackard, as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to replace retiring employee jobs. As many baby boomers reach retirement age, this mentorship program will help with the so-called “silver tsunami” set to occur as many current employees reach retirement age.

## Results:

### Retiring Titles

* The first deliverable included creating a new table called "Retiring Titles" which holds all titles of retirement-ready employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

* This table shows the largest number of retirement-ready employees in the Senior Engineer (29,414) and Senior Staff (28,254) departments. The other highly affected departments include Engineers with 14,222 employees and General Staff with 12,243 employees nearing retirement. The remaining departments included Techique Leaders (4502), Assistant Engineers (1761) and Managers (2).

### Mentorship-Eligibility

* The second deliverable included creating a mentorship-eligibility table which holds a list of current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

* This table shows 1,940 employees born in this one year who are eligible for the mentorship program. Another table with a larger scale of birth years would give a better idea of the number of total employees eligible for mentorship.

## Summary: 

* The Retiring Titles table shows just over 90,000 retirement-ready employees in various roles which will need to be filled. 
    
* This table also showed very large numbers of highly qualified, retirement-ready employees available for mentoring the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.  The manager role showed only 2 retiremnt-ready individuals so this department may need assistance in training future managers.

  In summary, a new table which provides all employees per title who are elegible for mentorship would give greater insight into the ability to support the upcoming wave of retiring individuals.  A separate table which provides a count of these mentorship-eligible employees would allow us to see a snapshot of numbers to compare to the Retiring Titles numbers (which shows the number of retirement-aged individuals in each department).
